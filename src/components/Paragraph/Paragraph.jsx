                        Iâ€™ve been teaching myself to code since June 2024 and have gained proficiencies in React, Python, JavaScript, Godot,  and HTML and CSS.
                        I always welcome new challenges and enjoy creating innovative solutions. My adaptability and attention to detail lend themselves well to problem-solving and debugging. As well as my technical skills I value working collaboratively and have developed excellent communication skills to convey ideas, updates and analysis.

                        I currently work as a Freelance Developer, contracting for an Australian pharmaceutical retro-synthesis company with a senior developer to hone my skills in React, TypeScript and package dependency updates. This helps me develop my skills in day-to-day agile workflows, while I look for full-time roles within UK companies.

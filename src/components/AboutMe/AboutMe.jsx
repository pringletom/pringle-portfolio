           <Paragraph>Hi, I’m Tom! 
I’m a highly motivated self-taught web-developer. I’ve been learning to code since June 2024 and have gained proficiencies in React, Python, JavaScript, GDScript, and HTML and CSS.
I always welcome new challenges and enjoy creating innovative solutions. My adaptability and attention to detail lend themselves well to problem-solving and debugging. As well as my technical skills I value working collaboratively and have developed excellent communication skills to convey ideas, updates and analysis.
